 *  An unusually verbose version, but useful. The major, minor, and patch release numbers directly refer to Pascal's original JSON Zipper release. Following the upstream patch version, “play``XY``” portion indicates which major release of Play JSON is employed, and—finally—the last digit refers to the package version, tracking any changes in this release.
